  "content": "Five years ago, governments from around the world adopted the first legally-binding treaty to regulate the international transfer of conventional weapons in order to bring greater transparency and responsibility to the global arms trade. This week, the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) has reached an important milestone, with 100 States Parties joining the effort to stop the unregulated and irresponsible trade in conventional arms. As we celebrate this important step in the universalization of the ATT, there is still more that States can do to realize the full potential of the ATT.\nStimson’s Managing Director Rachel Stohl reflects on this important step in the universalization of the ATT and offers insights on ensuring a more responsible and transparent arms trade in the years to come. Stohl served as the consultant to the ATT process during the treaty’s negotiation and currently leads Stimson’s Arms Trade Treaty-Baseline Assessment Project.\nPlease click here to learn more.\n",
