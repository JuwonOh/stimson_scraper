  "title": "UAE Energy Diplomacy: Exporting Renewable Energy to the Global South",
  "time": "Sep 27, 2018",
  "content": "Over the past decade, the United Arab Emirates has emerged as a global leader in renewable energy innovation. The UAE’s record-setting prices for utility scale solar caught the world by surprise in 2014 and continued to attract international admiration after Abu Dhabi and Dubai achieved record-low solar prices below $.03 per kilowatt-hour. This breakthrough served as a global bellwether to remove any remaining doubts that solar power could compete with fossil fuels and put the UAE front and center in discussions of renewable energy. Internationally, the UAE’s spirited diplomatic support for the deployment of renewable energy projects in the Global South have placed it on equal footing with global powers such as the EU, US, and China. But compared to those countries, the UAE impressively achieved its success with far fewer resources at its disposal and thus serves as a standard bearer for developing countries. This success positions the UAE well to significantly expand efforts to promote sustainable development in the Global South and lead on renewable energy innovation.\nAn expansion of the UAE’s clean energy diplomacy could not be more timely. Almost every country’s Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) for carbon emissions under the Paris Agreement singles out electricity production as a key driver of growing emissions. However, most developing countries still lack the financial, technical, and human capacity to effectively expand their energy sectors while simultaneously limiting carbon emissions. Within this context, renewable energy is clearly identified as a key arena where international engagement can lead to a more ambitious emissions reduction target. The US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement has left a void that other international actors—whether government or private sector—can strategically fill.\nLike most countries in the Global South, the UAE faces development challenges related to rising energy demand, continued population growth, and ongoing industrialization and urbanization. Most analysis suggests that the Global South will contribute most of the projected carbon emissions in the coming decades under a business-as-usual scenario. Within this context, the Grand Transition—characterized by disruptive and innovative energy technologies like solar and wind, the digital revolution, and the shifting societal and economic environment as populations around the world grow and urbanize— presents a unique opportunity for strategic investment in renewable energy in the Global South. An appropriate application of policy engagement and pilot investment projects and policy engagement from renewable energy powerhouses like the UAE could reduce global carbon emissions and unlock billions of dollars of investment opportunities.\nThis publication provides context for renewable energy sector development in the UAE, identifies key lessons-learned from the UAE’s first decade of renewable energy leadership and engagement, and explores specific opportunities for the UAE’s leadership to further share these lessons with the Global South. \nAbout the Authors\nCourtney Weatherby is a Research Analyst with the Southeast Asia and Energy, Water, & Sustainability programs at the Stimson Center.
