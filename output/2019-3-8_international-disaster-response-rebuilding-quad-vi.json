    "In 2004, Australia, India, Japan, and the U.S. worked together to respond to the devastating Indian Ocean tsunami. In 2007, these four countries formed the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue – the Quad – seeking to deepen their cooperation, only to disband after a year. The Quad nations met again for consultations in 2017 and 2018, but the purpose of these meetings remains vague. This latest volume of the Views from the Next Generation series asks a compelling question: Could the Quad become a new platform for humanitarian assistance and disaster relief?",
    "With disasters occurring frequently in the Asia-Pacific region, the Quad’s own neighborhood, each country has experience and capabilities to leverage in humanitarian cooperation. Yet the Quad also faces many challenges, from its previous emphasis on security issues to each country’s level of commitment to such a forum. In this new collection of policy briefs, emerging experts from each of the Quad nations examine the potential benefits of and obstacles to rebuilding the Quad to focus on disaster response.",
    "This project, conceptualized and led by Director Yuki Tatsumi, examined the possibility of Quad cooperation in international disaster management with four policy briefs written by H. D. P. Envall, Ph.D., Fellow and Senior Lecturer, Department of International Relations, Australian National University; Yasuhito Jibiki, Assistant Professor, International Research Institute of Disaster Science, Tohoku University; Pamela Kennedy, Research Associate, East Asia Program, Stimson Center; Kate Stevenson, Fellow, Australia-Japan Research Centre; and Akriti Vasudeva, Research Associate, South Asia Program, Stimson Center. The project concluded with a publication launch event at the Stimson Center on March 11, 2019. The report was edited by Yuki Tatsumi and Research Assistant Jason Li, assisted by Research Interns Qiongyi Chen, Nagyung Lee, and Taro Sato.",
